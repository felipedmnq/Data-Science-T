# Data-Science-T
### Project developed during the "DS em Produção" course.

This project was develop using CRISP-DS (CRoss Industry Standard Process - Data Science) as project management method. During the course the students were challenged to go thru a "end to end" Data Scientist project, simulating, step by step, the real world of a Data Scientist.

During the project we went through the following CRISP-DS steps:

 * Business problem.
 * Business understanding.
 * Data collection.
 * Data cleaning.
 * Data exploration.
 * Data modeling.
 * Machine learning algorithms.
 * Algorithm evaluation.
 * Model deploy.

In summary, the project and the course was very productive. During this course we went thru a full data science end to end project and the biggest benefit gained, further the tecnical knoledge, was learn how to use the CRISP-DS methodology in a cyclical way, beeing abble to prepare the data, study the data, use and evaluate some ML algorithms and, at the end, put the best model into production using a telegram bot to see the model predictions directly from the smartphone.
